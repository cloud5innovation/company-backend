# About Cloud 5 Innovation 
There is a large misconception about digital agencies all over the world. Our prospect clients usually express there hesitation about working with an agency.
They say things like, “I’ve worked with an agency before and it was very impersonal.” Or “Digital Agencies cost way too much.” Or “Projects take forever to be completed when we work with an agency.”
Cloud5 was created by innovative and creative thinkers that wanted to mesh the freelance market with the large scale reach of a corporation. Insuring that when our clients trust us with their projects, it feels like they are trusting a friend, and a partner, while also obtaining the power of working with a team of experienced developers and problem solvers.
Founded in February 2018 by Dailan Cooper and Arielle Felix. Cloud5 has grown into a fast paced, creative, and multifaceted platform where backyard barbecue ideas become reality. Affordability, friendly freethinkers, youthful excitement, and a hunger to complete projects well before the deadline, all while paying close attention to details. This is our team, and this is what you get when we become your partner.
We are based out of the IT company’s paradise of Austin, Texas, and each of our developers has over 5 years experience, pare this with a great team of leaders and our powerhouse CEO Dailan Cooper, and we often wonder, why people have to wonder why Cloud5 Innovation is growing as fast as we are. We’re creating the Future, come join us…
